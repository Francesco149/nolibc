Collection of reusable libc-free code that I copypaste and tweak
in every libc-free project.

This is all linux-specific, amd64 and i386 only for now.

# Disclaimer
These snippets might be incomplete, broken or just plain wrong,
as many of them haven't had the chance to be heavily tested yet.

This is not meant to be a general purpose library. This is
basically me backing up my code snippets on github.

This code is public domain and comes with no warranty.
You are free to do whatever you want with it. You can
contact me at lolisamurai@tfwno.gf but don't expect any
support.
I hope you will find the code useful or at least
interesting to read. Have fun!
